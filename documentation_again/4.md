Set LOW=0 and HIGH=arr.size - 1.
While LOW <= HIGH:
  - Get arr[(LOW + HIGH) / 2].
  - If it's equal to the target, return true.
  - If it's less than the target value, set LOW = (LOW + HIGH) / 2 + 1.
  - If it's greater than the target value, set HIGH = (LOW + HIGH) / 2 - 1.
  - Return false if neither LOW nor HIGH have updated.

Array#bsearch in find-min mode returns the first element for which the block returns true. Thus:

`puts a.bsearch { |item| item > 8 }`
